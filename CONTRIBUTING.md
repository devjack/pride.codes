# Contributing

Code contributions are actively encouraged, either via issues (reporting a bug) or pull requests (contributing code).
Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](CODEOFCONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your contributions to this project.

## Bugs & issues
When reporting a bug, we value the extra time you take to include details such as:
 - What browser/environment/versions etc. you're using
 - Steps to reproduce *before* the bug occurred. (if outside the normal tutorial)
 - A reproducable example (this helps us form a test case)
 - Environment/configuration that is relevant to your bug.

## Pull Requests

1. First create an issue to discuss the feature you wish to implement. e.g. "We need a flag that looks like X."
2. Ensure that the suggested contribution doesn't require extensive dependencies and is as 'lightweight' as possible.
3. If substantially changing or 'breaking' a widget, consider adding it as a variation instead.
4. Make sure that the code looks nice. We don't enforce linting, we do like to read what you've worked hard on.
