http://pride.codes  is a collection of simple web widgets that allow you to show your support for marriage equality and the LGBTIQ communnity.

If you have a website with an Australian audience please add a Vote Yes corner. Our code is open source, so feel free to play around with it - we welcome all feedback!

In the near future, http://pride.codes  will be a hub of information and resources for Australian LGBTIQ tech workers, employers and supporters, if you're interested in helping us, please get in touch.
